Put a uniform meter scale horizontally on your extended index fingers with the left one at $0.00 \mathrm{~cm}$ and the right one at $90.00 \mathrm{~cm}$. When you attempt to move both the fingers slowly towards the center, initially only the left finger slips with respect to the scale and the right finger does not.

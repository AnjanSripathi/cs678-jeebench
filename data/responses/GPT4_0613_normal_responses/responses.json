            "content": "(A) The temperature distribution over the filament is uniform\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The temperature distribution over the filament may not be uniform due to non-uniform evaporation of tungsten from the filament. This non-uniform evaporation can lead to thinning of the filament at certain points, which can cause these points to become hotter than the rest of the filament.\n\n(B) The resistance over small sections of the filament decreases with time\n\nThis statement is true. As the filament evaporates, it becomes thinner and its length decreases. According to the formula for resistance (R = \u03c1L/A, where \u03c1 is resistivity, L is length, and A is cross-sectional area), a decrease in length and cross-sectional area would lead to a decrease in resistance.\n\n(C) The filament emits more light at higher band of frequencies before it breaks up\n\nThis statement is true. As the filament gets hotter, it emits more light at higher frequencies. This is due to Planck's law of black-body radiation, which states that the intensity of radiation emitted by a black body (in this case, the filament) increases with frequency (and thus energy) to a point, after which it decreases with increasing frequency.\n\n(D) The filament consumes less electrical power towards the end of the life of the bulb\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The power consumed by the filament is given by P = V^2/R, where V is the voltage and R is the resistance. As the filament evaporates and its resistance decreases, the power consumed would actually increase, assuming the voltage remains constant.\n\nFinal Answer: (B) and (C) are true."

For the convex surface, the radius of curvature R1 is taken as positive.\n\nSubstituting the values in the lens maker's formula, we get:\n\n1/20 = (n-1)(1/R1 - 0)\n\nSolving for n, we get:\n\nn = 1 + 20/R1\n\nNow, the faint image formed due to reflection from the convex surface is given by the mirror formula:\n\n1/f' = 1/v' + 1/u'\n\nwhere f' is the focal length of the mirror, v' is the image distance, and u' is the object distance.\n\nFor a convex mirror, the focal length f' = -R1/2 and the image distance v' = -10 cm (negative because the image is behind the mirror).\n\nSubstituting these values in the mirror formula, we get:\n\n-2/R1 = 1/(-10) + 1/(-30)\n\nSolving for R1, we get:\n\nR1 = 45 cm.\n\nSubstituting R1 in the equation for n, we get:\n\nn = 1 + 20/45 = 2.5/3 = 5/6.\n\nSo, the refractive index of the lens is not 2.5, it is 5/6.\n\nThe faint image formed due to reflection is virtual and erect because it is formed by a convex mirror.\n\nFinal Answer: (B) The radius of curvature of the convex surface is 45 cm, (C) The faint image is erect and real, (D) The focal length of the lens is 20 cm."

The ratio v_P / v_Q is then:\n\nv_P / v_Q = [(2/9) * (r_P^2) * g * (\u03c1_P - \u03c1_fP) / \u03b7_P] / [(2/9) * (r_Q^2) * g * (\u03c1_Q - \u03c1_fQ) / \u03b7_Q]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nv_P / v_Q = (r_P^2 / r_Q^2) * (\u03c1_P - \u03c1_fP) / (\u03c1_Q - \u03c1_fQ) * (\u03b7_Q / \u03b7_P)\n\nGiven that the densities of the spheres are the same (\u03c1_P = \u03c1_Q = 8 gm/cm^3), the radii are r_P = 0.5 cm and r_Q = 0.25 cm (half the diameters), the densities of the fluids are \u03c1_fP = 0.8 gm/cm^3 and \u03c1_fQ = 1.6 gm/cm^3, and the viscosities are \u03b7_P = 3 poiseulles and \u03b7_Q = 2 poiseulles, we can substitute these values into the equation to get:\n\nv_P / v_Q = (0.5^2 / 0.25^2) * (8 - 0.8) / (8 - 1.6) * (2 / 3)\n\nSolving this gives:\n\nv_P / v_Q = 4 * 7.2 / 6.4 * 2/3 = 1.5\n\nSo the ratio of the terminal velocities of P and Q is 1.5.\n\nFinal Answer: 1.5"

Therefore, this mode of decay is not possible for a nucleus with N/P ratio less than 1.\n\n(B) Orbital or K-electron capture: In this process, a proton in the nucleus captures an electron from the innermost (K) shell of the atom and is converted into a neutron. This decreases the number of protons and increases the number of neutrons, thus increasing the N/P ratio. Therefore, this mode of decay is possible for a nucleus with N/P ratio less than 1.\n\n(C) Neutron emission: In this process, a neutron is simply emitted from the nucleus. This decreases the number of neutrons and does not change the number of protons, thus decreasing the N/P ratio. Therefore, this mode of decay is not possible for a nucleus with N/P ratio less than 1.\n\n(D) $\\beta^{+}$-decay (positron emission): In this process, a proton in the nucleus is converted into a neutron with the emission of a positron (the antiparticle of the electron) and a neutrino. This decreases the number of protons and increases the number of neutrons, thus increasing the N/P ratio. Therefore, this mode of decay is possible for a nucleus with N/P ratio less than 1.\n\nFinal Answer: (B) Orbital or K-electron capture and (D) $\\beta^{+}$-decay (positron emission) are the possible modes of decay for an unstable nucleus having N/P ratio less than 1."

Since $S$ is directly above $T$, the coordinates of $S$ are $S(1.5,1.5,3)$.\n\n(A) The vectors $\\overrightarrow{OQ}$ and $\\overrightarrow{OS}$ are $(3,3,0)$ and $(1.5,1.5,3)$ respectively. The cosine of the angle between these vectors is given by the dot product of the vectors divided by the product of their magnitudes. The dot product is $(3*1.5 + 3*1.5 + 0*3) = 9$, and the magnitudes are $\\sqrt{3^2 + 3^2 + 0^2} = 3\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{1.5^2 + 1.5^2 + 3^2} = 3\\sqrt{2}$. So, the cosine of the angle is $\\frac{9}{(3\\sqrt{2})(3\\sqrt{2})} = \\frac{1}{2}$, which means the angle is $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$. So, option (A) is correct.\n\n(B) The equation of the plane containing the points $O$, $Q$, and $S$ can be found by taking the cross product of the vectors $\\overrightarrow{OQ}$ and $\\overrightarrow{OS}$ to get the normal vector to the plane, and then using the point-normal form of the equation of a plane. The cross product is $(3*3 - 3*1.5, 3*1.5 - 0*3, 3*3 - 3*1.5) = (4.5, 4.5, 4.5)$, so the equation of the plane is $4.5(x - 0) + 4.5(y - 0) + 4.5(z - 0) = 0$, or $x + y + z = 0$. So, option (B) is not correct.\n\n(C) The length of the perpendicular from $P$ to the plane containing $O$, $Q$, and $S$ is given by the formula $\\frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + Cz_1 + D|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2 + C^2}}$, where $(A,B,C)$ is the normal vector to the plane, $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ is the point $P$, and $D$ is the constant term in the equation of the plane. In this case, $A = B = C = 4.5$, $x_1 = 3$, $y_1 = z_1 = 0$, and $D = 0$, so the length of the perpendicular is $\\frac{|4.5*3 + 4.5*0 + 4.5*0 + 0|}{\\sqrt{4.5^2 + 4.5^2 + 4.5^2}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}$. So, option (C) is correct.\n\n(D) The perpendicular distance from $O$ to the line containing $R$ and $S$ can be found by finding the vector $\\overrightarrow{RS}$, normalizing it, and then taking the dot product of this unit vector with the vector $\\overrightarrow{OR}$. The vector $\\overrightarrow{RS}$ is $(1.5 - 0, 1.5 - 3, 3 - 0) = (1.5, -1.5, 3)$, and its magnitude is $\\sqrt{1.5^2 + (-1.5)^2 + 3^2} = 3\\sqrt{2}$. So, the unit vector in the direction of $\\overrightarrow{RS}$ is $(1.5/3\\sqrt{2}, -1.5/3\\sqrt{2}, 3/3\\sqrt{2}) = (1/\\sqrt{8}, -1/\\sqrt{8}, 1/\\sqrt{2})$. The vector $\\overrightarrow{OR}$ is $(0 - 0, 3 - 0, 0 - 0) = (0, 3, 0)$, so the dot product is $(0*1/\\sqrt{8} + 3*(-1/\\sqrt{8}) + 0*1/\\sqrt{2}) = -3/\\sqrt{8} = -\\sqrt{6/8} = -\\sqrt{3/4}$, which is not equal to $\\sqrt{15/2}$. So, option (D) is not correct.\n\nFinal Answer: (A), (C)"

            "content": "The equation of the circle is $x^{2}+y^{2}=3$ and the equation of the parabola is $x^{2}=2y$. \n\nThe point of intersection of the circle and the parabola in the first quadrant is obtained by solving these two equations simultaneously. Substituting $x^{2}=2y$ in the equation of the circle, we get $2y+y^{2}=3$ or $y^{2}+2y-3=0$. Solving this quadratic equation, we get $y=1$ or $y=-3$. Since we are looking for the point in the first quadrant, we take $y=1$. Substituting $y=1$ in the equation of the parabola, we get $x^{2}=2$ or $x=\\sqrt{2}$. So, the point of intersection $P$ is $(\\sqrt{2},1)$.\n\nThe slope of the tangent to the circle at $P$ is given by the negative reciprocal of the slope of the radius $OP$. The slope of $OP$ is $\\frac{1-0}{\\sqrt{2}-0}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. So, the slope of the tangent is $-\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe equation of the tangent is $y-1=-\\sqrt{2}(x-\\sqrt{2})$ or $y=-\\sqrt{2}x+2\\sqrt{2}+1$.\n\nThe centres $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ of the circles $C_{2}$ and $C_{3}$ lie on the y-axis. So, their x-coordinates are 0. Substituting $x=0$ in the equation of the tangent, we get $y=2\\sqrt{2}+1$ and $y=-2\\sqrt{2}+1$. So, the centres $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ are $(0,2\\sqrt{2}+1)$ and $(0,-2\\sqrt{2}+1)$ respectively.\n\n(A) The distance between $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ is $|2\\sqrt{2}+1-(-2\\sqrt{2}+1)|=4\\sqrt{2}=5.65685$ which is not equal to 12. So, option (A) is incorrect.\n\n(B) The points $R_{2}$ and $R_{3}$ are the points of tangency of the tangent to the circle $C_{1}$ with the circles $C_{2}$ and $C_{3}$. The distance between $R_{2}$ and $R_{3}$ is equal to the difference of the distances of $P$ from $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$. The distance of $P$ from $Q_{2}$ is $\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{2}-0)^{2}+(1-(2\\sqrt{2}+1))^{2}}=\\sqrt{2+3}=2\\sqrt{2}$. The distance of $P$ from $Q_{3}$ is $\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{2}-0)^{2}+(1-(-2\\sqrt{2}+1))^{2}}=\\sqrt{2+9}=2\\sqrt{3}$. So, the distance between $R_{2}$ and $R_{3}$ is $|2\\sqrt{2}-2\\sqrt{3}|=2(\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{2})=1.317$ which is not equal to $4\\sqrt{6}$. So, option (B) is incorrect.\n\n(C) The triangle $OR_{2}R_{3}$ is a right triangle with $OR_{2}=OR_{3}=\\sqrt{3}$ (the radius of the circle $C_{1}$) and $R_{2}R_{3}=2(\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{2})$. So, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}\\times OR_{2}\\times R_{2}R_{3}=\\frac{1}{2}\\times\\sqrt{3}\\times2(\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{2})=\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{2})=0.317$ which is not equal to $6\\sqrt{2}$. So, option (C) is incorrect.\n\n(D) The triangle $PQ_{2}Q_{3}$ is a right triangle with $PQ_{2}=2\\sqrt{2}$ and $PQ_{3}=2\\sqrt{3}$. So, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}\\times PQ_{2}\\times PQ_{3}=\\frac{1}{2}\\times2\\sqrt{2}\\times2\\sqrt{3}=2\\sqrt{6}=4.899$ which is not equal to $4\\sqrt{2}$. So, option (D) is incorrect.\n\nSo, none of the options is correct."

The temperature difference across wire RS (\u0394T2) is the difference between the average temperature of the wire and the temperature at S (400\u00b0C). Therefore, we can write:\n\n2(10 - Tavg) = Tavg - 400\n\nSolving this equation for Tavg, we get Tavg = 140\u00b0C.\n\nThe change in length of the wire PQ due to thermal expansion is given by the equation \u0394L = \u03b1L\u0394T, where \u03b1 is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion, L is the original length of the wire, and \u0394T is the temperature difference.\n\nSubstituting the given values into this equation, we get:\n\n\u0394L = (1.2 x 10^-5 K^-1)(1 m)(140\u00b0C - 10\u00b0C) = 0.00156 m = 1.56 mm\n\nTherefore, the change in length of the wire PQ is 1.56 mm.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C) $1.56 \\mathrm{~mm}$."

This results in a higher vapor pressure than expected, which indicates a positive deviation.\n\n(A) Carbon tetrachloride + Methanol: Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) is a non-polar molecule, while methanol (CH3OH) is a polar molecule. The interaction between CCl4 and CH3OH is weaker than the interaction between CCl4-CCl4 and CH3OH-CH3OH.

            "content": "Solution:\n\n(A) Crushing followed by concentration of the ore by froth-flotation: This is the first step in the extraction of copper from its ore. The ore is crushed and then concentrated by froth-flotation process. This process involves the crushing of the ore into a fine powder and then mixed with water, oil, and detergents to form a slurry. The slurry is then agitated, causing the copper minerals to stick to the bubbles and float to the surface where they can be collected. So, option (A) is correct.\n\n(B) Removal of iron as slag: After the concentration of the ore, it is then roasted in the presence of air to convert it into crude copper. The iron present in the ore is converted into iron silicate, which is removed as slag. So, option (B) is correct.\n\n(C) Self-reduction step to produce 'blister copper' following evolution of $\\mathrm{SO}_{2}$: After roasting, the ore is mixed with silica and heated in a blast furnace to produce matte copper. The matte copper is then subjected to a self-reduction process where it reacts with the remaining iron sulfide to produce 'blister copper' and sulfur dioxide gas. So, option (C) is correct.\n\n(D) Refining of 'blister copper' by carbon reduction: This is not correct. The refining of 'blister copper' is not done by carbon reduction. Instead, it is done by electrolytic refining. In this process, impure copper is made the anode and a thin sheet of pure copper is made the cathode. The electrolyte used is copper sulphate solution. When electricity is passed, copper from the impure anode dissolves and is deposited on the cathode. The impurities fall off into the solution as anode mud. So, option (D) is not correct.\n\nFinal Answer: (A), (B), (C)"

Therefore, option (A) is incorrect.\n\nInvert sugar is indeed an equimolar mixture of D-(+)-glucose and D-(-)-fructose. Therefore, option (B) is correct.\n\nThe specific rotation of a mixture is the weighted average of the specific rotations of its components. Since invert sugar is an equimolar mixture of D-(+)-glucose and D-(-)-fructose, its specific rotation is the average of the specific rotations of D-(+)-glucose and D-(-)-fructose, which are -52\u00b0 and +92\u00b0, respectively. Therefore, the specific rotation of invert sugar is (-52\u00b0 + 92\u00b0)/2 = 20\u00b0. However, the sign of the specific rotation of a mixture also depends on the relative proportions of its components. In the case of invert sugar, the specific rotation is negative because fructose rotates plane-polarized light to a greater extent than glucose does.

The equation of the parabola can be written as $y^2 = 4x \\Rightarrow y = \\pm 2\\sqrt{x}$. \n\nThe distance between the point $P(x,y)$ on the parabola and the center $S(2,8)$ of the circle is given by $SP = \\sqrt{(x-2)^2 + (y-8)^2}$. \n\nSince $P$ is on the parabola, we can substitute $y = \\pm 2\\sqrt{x}$ into the distance formula to get $SP = \\sqrt{(x-2)^2 + (2\\sqrt{x}-8)^2}$. \n\nTo minimize this distance, we take the derivative of $SP$ with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero. \n\n$\\frac{d(SP)}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (x-2)^2 + (2\\sqrt{x}-8)^2 \\right]^{-1/2} \\left[ 2(x-2) + 2(2\\sqrt{x}-8) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x}} \\right] = 0$\n\nSolving this equation gives $x = 5$ and $y = \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}$.

Substituting $x = 5$ and $y = 2\\sqrt{5}$ into the equation of the circle gives $25 + 20 - 20\\sqrt{5} + 64 - 32\\sqrt{5} + 64 = 0$, which simplifies to $SQ:QP = (\\sqrt{5}+1):2$, so option (B) is correct. \n\nThe equation of the normal to the parabola at $P$ is given by $y - 2\\sqrt{5} = -\\frac{1}{4}(x - 5)$.

The slope of $SQ$ is $\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}-8}{5-2} = -2\\sqrt{5} + 4$, so the slope of the tangent is $-\\frac{1}{-2\\sqrt{5} + 4} = \\frac{1}{2}$, so option (D) is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct options are (A), (B), (C), and (D)."

The resistive force is proportional to the rate of momentum transfer from the gas molecules to the plate. \n\nThe rate of momentum transfer is proportional to the number of collisions per unit time, which is in turn proportional to the relative speed of the gas molecules and the plate. Since the speed of the plate $v$ is much less than the average speed $u$ of the gas molecules, the relative speed is approximately equal to $u$. Therefore, the resistive force is proportional to $u$ and not $v$. This rules out option [B].\n\nThe pressure difference between the leading and trailing faces of the plate is also proportional to the rate of momentum transfer, and hence to $u$. However, it is not proportional to $v$, because the relative speed of the gas molecules and the plate is approximately equal to $u$ and not $v$. This rules out option [A].\n\nThe plate is moving under the action of a constant force $F$. As long as the resistive force is less than $F$, the plate will continue to accelerate. However, as the speed of the plate increases, the resistive force will also increase. Eventually, the resistive force will equal the external force $F$, and the plate will move with a constant speed. This rules out option [C].\n\nAt a later time, the external force $F$ will balance the resistive force, as explained above.

            "content": "[A] The amount of energy radiated by the body in 1 second is close to 60 Joules\n\nThe energy radiated by a body per unit time per unit area is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the power radiated per unit area of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature. This can be written as:\n\nP = \u03c3T^4\n\nwhere P is the power radiated per unit area, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. \n\nGiven that the body temperature is 10K above the room temperature, the body's absolute temperature is 310K. The power radiated per unit area is therefore:\n\nP = \u03c3(310)^4 = 480 W/m^2\n\nThe total power radiated by the body is then:\n\nP_total = P * A = 480 W/m^2 * 1 m^2 = 480 W\n\nThe energy radiated by the body in 1 second is therefore:\n\nE = P_total * t = 480 W * 1 s = 480 J\n\nSo, option [A] is incorrect.\n\n[B] If the surrounding temperature reduces by a small amount \u0394T0 \u226a T0, then to maintain the same body temperature the same (living) human being needs to radiate \u0394W=4\u03c3T0^3\u0394T0 more energy per unit time\n\nThis statement is derived from the Stefan-Boltzmann law. If we differentiate the Stefan-Boltzmann law with respect to temperature, we get:\n\ndP/dT = 4\u03c3T^3\n\nThis means that the change in power radiated per unit area for a small change in temperature is given by:\n\n\u0394P = 4\u03c3T0^3\u0394T0\n\nSo, option [B] is correct.\n\n[C] Reducing the exposed surface area of the body (e.g. by curling up) allows humans to maintain the same body temperature while reducing the energy lost by radiation\n\nThis statement is correct. The total power radiated by a body is given by P = \u03c3AT^4, where A is the surface area of the body. Therefore, by reducing the surface area, the total power radiated (and hence the energy lost by radiation) is reduced. So, option [C] is correct.\n\n[D] If the body temperature rises significantly then the peak in the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation emitted by the body would shift to longer wavelengths\n\nThis statement is incorrect. According to Wien's displacement law, the peak wavelength of the radiation emitted by a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature. Therefore, if the body temperature rises, the peak wavelength would shift to shorter, not longer, wavelengths. So, option [D] is incorrect.\n\nFinal Answer: [B], [C]"

For an isosceles prism, when the angle of incidence $i_{1}$ is equal to the angle of the prism $A$, the ray inside the prism is parallel to the base of the prism. This is because the angle of refraction $r_{1}$ at the first surface is equal to the angle of incidence $i_{2}$ at the second surface, and the sum of these angles is equal to the angle of the prism $A$. Therefore, the ray inside the prism is parallel to the base of the prism.\n\n[B] For this prism, the refractive index $\\mu$ and the angle of prism $A$ are related as $A=\\frac{1}{2} \\cos ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2}\\right)$\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The refractive index $\\mu$ and the angle of prism $A$ are related by the formula $\\mu = \\sin\\left(\\frac{A+\\delta_m}{2}\\right) / \\sin\\left(\\frac{A}{2}\\right)$. Given that $\\delta_m = A$, this simplifies to $\\mu = \\sin A / \\sin\\left(\\frac{A}{2}\\right)$, which is not the same as the relationship given in the statement.\n\n[C] At minimum deviation, the incident angle $i_{1}$ and the refracting angle $r_{1}$ at the first refracting surface are related by $r_{1}=\\left(i_{1} / 2\\right)$\n\nThis statement is incorrect. At minimum deviation, the incident angle $i_{1}$ and the refracting angle $r_{1}$ at the first refracting surface are related by Snell's law, which states that $\\mu = \\sin i_{1} / \\sin r_{1}$. This relationship is not the same as the one given in the statement.\n\n[D] For this prism, the emergent ray at the second surface will be tangential to the surface when the angle of incidence at the first surface is $i_{1}=\\sin ^{-1}\\left[\\sin A \\sqrt{4 \\cos ^{2} \\frac{A}{2}-1}-\\cos A\\right]$\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The condition for the emergent ray to be tangential to the second surface is that the angle of incidence at the first surface $i_{1}$ should be such that the angle of refraction at the second surface $r_{2}$ is $90^{\\circ}$. Using Snell's law, this gives $i_{1} = \\sin^{-1}(\\mu)$, which is not the same as the expression given in the statement.\n\nFinal Answer: [A] For the angle of incidence $i_{1}=A$, the ray inside the prism is parallel to the base of the prism."

Taking the logarithm base 10 of both sides, we get \u03b1 = log10(1.331) \u2248 0.124.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the final answer will be a non-negative integer. Since K represents the number of identical drops, it must be an integer. Therefore, we round \u03b1 to the nearest integer, which gives \u03b1 = 0. \n\nSo, the final answer is 0."

The work done on the gas is maximum when it is compressed reversibly, not irreversibly. In a reversible process, the system is always in equilibrium with its surroundings, and the work done is maximum. In an irreversible process, the system is not in equilibrium with its surroundings, and the work done is less than in a reversible process.\n\n[B] If the expansion is carried out freely, it is simultaneously both isothermal as well as adiabatic\n\nThis statement is correct. A free expansion is an adiabatic process because no heat is exchanged with the surroundings. It is also an isothermal process because the temperature remains constant. This is because the gas does no work and no heat is transferred, so the internal energy (which is proportional to the temperature) remains constant.\n\n[C] The work done by the gas is less when it is expanded reversibly from $\\mathrm{V}_{1}$ to $\\mathrm{V}_{2}$ under adiabatic conditions as compared to that when expanded reversibly from $V_{1}$ to $\\mathrm{V}_{2}$ under isothermal conditions\n\nThis statement is correct. The work done by the gas in an adiabatic process is less than in an isothermal process. This is because in an adiabatic process, the gas does work and its internal energy decreases, causing the temperature to decrease. In an isothermal process, the temperature remains constant because heat is transferred to the gas to compensate for the work done, so the work done is greater.\n\n[D] The change in internal energy of the gas is (i) zero, if it is expanded reversibly with $\\mathrm{T}_{1}=\\mathrm{T}_{2}$, and (ii) positive, if it is expanded reversibly under adiabatic conditions with $\\mathrm{T}_{1} \\neq \\mathrm{T}_{2}$\n\nThis statement is partially correct. The change in internal energy of the gas is indeed zero if it is expanded reversibly with $\\mathrm{T}_{1}=\\mathrm{T}_{2}$, because the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature. However, if the gas is expanded reversibly under adiabatic conditions with $\\mathrm{T}_{1} \\neq \\mathrm{T}_{2}$, the change in internal energy is negative, not positive. This is because in an adiabatic expansion, the gas does work and its internal energy decreases, causing the temperature to decrease.\n\nFinal Answer: [B], [C], [D(i)]"

When a substance absorbs light, the energy of the light is used to excite electrons from a lower energy level to a higher energy level.

            "content": "Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, a+d, a+2d, where a is the smallest side, a+d is the middle side, and a+2d is the largest side. Since the triangle is right-angled, the largest side is the hypotenuse. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n(a+2d)^2 = a^2 + (a+d)^2\na^2 + 4ad + 4d^2 = a^2 + 2ad + d^2\n2ad + 3d^2 = 0\n2ad = -3d^2\n2a = -3d\n\nSince a is the smallest side, it must be positive. Therefore, d must be negative. Let's denote d = -b, where b is a positive number. Then, we have:\n\n2a = 3b\na = 3b/2\n\nThe area of the triangle is given by 1/2 * base * height. We can take the base to be a and the height to be a+b. Therefore, we have:\n\n24 = 1/2 * a * (a+b)\n48 = a^2 + ab\n48 = (3b/2)^2 + (3b/2)*b\n48 = 9b^2/4 + 3b^2/2\n48 = 9b^2/4 + 6b^2/4\n48 = 15b^2/4\n192 = 15b^2\nb^2 = 192/15\nb^2 = 64/5\nb = sqrt(64/5)\nb = 8/sqrt(5)\nb = 8*sqrt(5)/5\n\nThen, the smallest side a is:\n\na = 3b/2\na = 3*8*sqrt(5)/5/2\na = 12*sqrt(5)/5\n\nTherefore, the length of the smallest side is 12*sqrt(5)/5.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the final answer will be a non-negative integer. This means that we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check.\n\nThe mistake is in the step where we equated 2ad = -3d^2 to get 2a = -3d. This step is incorrect because it assumes that d is not zero, which is not necessarily true. In fact, if the sides of the triangle are in arithmetic progression, then d must be zero. This means that all three sides of the triangle are equal, which is not possible for a right-angled triangle.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to use the fact that the area of the triangle is given by 1/2 * base * height, and that the base and height are in arithmetic progression. Let's denote the base as a and the height as a+d. Then, we have:\n\n24 = 1/2 * a * (a+d)\n48 = a^2 + ad\n48 = a(a + d)\n\nSince a is the smallest side, a < a+d. Therefore, a^2 < 48, so a < sqrt(48) = 4*sqrt(3). The largest integer less than 4*sqrt(3) is 6. Therefore, the smallest side a must be 6.\n\nFinal Answer: 6."

            "content": "[A] Adsorption is accompanied by decrease in enthalpy and decrease in entropy of the system\n\nThis statement is correct. Adsorption is an exothermic process, meaning it releases heat and thus results in a decrease in enthalpy (\u2206H is negative). During adsorption, the randomness or disorder of the system decreases as the gas molecules get adsorbed on the solid surface and become less mobile. This results in a decrease in entropy (\u2206S is negative).\n\n[B] The critical temperatures of ethane and nitrogen are $563 \\mathrm{~K}$ and $126 \\mathrm{~K}$, respectively. The adsorption of ethane will be more than that of nitrogen on same amount of activated charcoal at a given temperature\n\nThis statement is correct. The critical temperature of a gas is the temperature above which it cannot be liquefied, no matter how much pressure is applied. The higher the critical temperature, the stronger are the intermolecular forces of attraction. Ethane has a higher critical temperature than nitrogen, indicating stronger intermolecular forces of attraction. Therefore, ethane will be adsorbed more than nitrogen on the same amount of activated charcoal at a given temperature.\n\n[C] Cloud is an emulsion type of colloid in which liquid is dispersed phase and gas is dispersion medium\n\nThis statement is incorrect. A cloud is actually an aerosol type of colloid, not an emulsion. In a cloud, tiny water droplets or ice crystals (the dispersed phase) are dispersed in air (the dispersion medium).\n\n[D] Brownian motion of colloidal particles does not depend on the size of the particles but depends on viscosity of the solution\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The Brownian motion of colloidal particles is affected by both the size of the particles and the viscosity of the solution. Smaller particles and lower viscosity result in greater Brownian motion.\n\nFinal Answer: [A] and [B] are correct."

For an exothermic reaction, the enthalpy change $\\Delta H$ is negative.

For an endothermic reaction, the enthalpy change $\\Delta H$ is positive. According to the Van't Hoff equation, if $\\Delta H$ is positive and temperature $T$ increases, the value of $K$ should increase. This is because the unfavourable change in entropy of the surroundings (which is negative) decreases, making the overall entropy change less negative or more positive, which increases the value of $K$.\n\n[C] With increase in temperature, the value of $K$ for endothermic reaction increases because the entropy change of the system is negative.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. For an endothermic reaction, the entropy change of the system is usually positive (since the system absorbs heat and becomes more disordered), not negative.\n\n[D] With increase in temperature, the value of $K$ for exothermic reaction decreases because favourable change in entropy of the surroundings decreases.\n\nThis statement is correct. For an exothermic reaction, the enthalpy change $\\Delta H$ is negative and the system releases heat to the surroundings, increasing the entropy of the surroundings (a favourable change). However, as temperature $T$ increases, this favourable change in entropy of the surroundings decreases, which decreases the value of $K$.\n\nFinal Answer: [B] and [D] are correct."

It is the ratio of the rate constant determined experimentally to the rate constant predicted by the collision theory. \n\nThe steric factor P is given by the equation:\n\nP = k_experimental / k_theoretical\n\nwhere k_experimental is the rate constant determined experimentally and k_theoretical is the rate constant predicted by the collision theory.\n\nThe steric factor P can be greater than 1 if the experimental rate constant is greater than the theoretical rate constant.

The steric factor only affects the rate constant of the reaction.\n\n[B] Experimentally determined value of frequency factor is higher than that predicted by Arrhenius equation\n\nThis statement is correct. The frequency factor, also known as the pre-exponential factor, is a measure of the frequency of collisions between reactant molecules. If the steric factor P is greater than 1, this means that the experimental rate constant is greater than the theoretical rate constant. Therefore, the experimentally determined frequency factor must also be greater than the frequency factor predicted by the Arrhenius equation.\n\n[C] Since P=4.5, the reaction will not proceed unless an effective catalyst is used\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The steric factor P does not determine whether a reaction will proceed or not. It only affects the rate at which the reaction proceeds. A reaction can still proceed even if the steric factor P is greater than 1, it just means that the reaction proceeds at a faster rate than predicted by the collision theory.\n\n[D] The value of frequency factor predicted by Arrhenius equation is higher than that determined experimentally\n\nThis statement is incorrect.

The trace of a matrix is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues. \n\nThe trace of the product of two matrices is equal to the trace of their product in the opposite order. Therefore, the trace of $M^{T} M$ is equal to the trace of $MM^{T}$.\n\nThe diagonal entries of $MM^{T}$ are the sums of the squares of the entries in the corresponding rows of $M$. Therefore, we are looking for the number of $3 \\times 3$ matrices with entries from $\\{0,1,2\\}$ such that the sum of the squares of the entries in each row is $5$.\n\nThe possible sums of squares for a row are $0^2+0^2+0^2=0$, $1^2+1^2+1^2=3$, $2^2+2^2+2^2=12$, $1^2+1^2+2^2=6$, $1^2+2^2+2^2=9$, $0^2+1^2+2^2=5$, $0^2+0^2+1^2=1$, $0^2+0^2+2^2=4$, $0^2+1^2+1^2=2$, $1^2+2^2+0^2=5$, $2^2+0^2+0^2=4$, $2^2+1^2+0^2=5$, $2^2+2^2+0^2=8$, $2^2+2^2+1^2=9$, $2^2+1^2+1^2=6$.\n\nOut of these, only $0^2+1^2+2^2=5$, $1^2+2^2+0^2=5$, and $2^2+1^2+0^2=5$ give a sum of $5$. \n\nFor each of these three cases, there are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange the numbers in a row. Therefore, there are $3 \\times 6 = 18$ possible rows.\n\nSince there are $3$ rows in the matrix, there are $18^3 = 5832$ possible matrices. However, this counts each matrix $3! = 6$ times, once for each permutation of the rows. Therefore, the number of distinct matrices is $5832 / 6 = 972$.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the matrices where two or three rows are the same.

There are $3 \\times 18 = 54$ such matrices.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct matrices is $486 - 54 = 432$.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the matrices where the same row appears three times. There are $18$ such matrices.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct matrices is $432 - 18 = 414$.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the matrices where two different rows each appear twice. There are $3 \\times \\binom{18}{2} = 486$ such matrices.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct matrices is $414 - 486/2 = 171$.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the matrices where three different rows each appear once. There are $\\binom{18}{3} = 816$ such matrices.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct matrices is $171 - 816/6 = 171 - 136 = 35$.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the matrices where two different rows appear three times each. There are $3 \\times \\binom{18}{2} = 486$ such matrices.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct matrices is $35 - 486/6 = 35 - 81 = -46$.\n\nThis is not possible, so we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.\n\nThe mistake is in the step where we calculated the number of matrices where two or three rows are the same. We should have divided by $2! = 2$ for the matrices where two rows are the same, and by $3! = 6$ for the matrices where all three rows are the same.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of matrices where two or three rows are the same is $918/2 + 54/6 = 459 + 9 = 468$.\n\nSubtracting this from our previous total gives $972 - 468 = 504$.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the matrices where the same row appears twice. There are $3 \\times 18 = 54$ such matrices.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of distinct matrices is $504 - 54 = 450$.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the matrices where the same row appears three times. There are $18$ such matrices.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of distinct matrices is $450 - 18 = 432$.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the matrices where two different rows each appear twice. There are $3 \\times \\binom{18}{2} = 486$ such matrices.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of distinct matrices is $432 - 486/2 = 189$.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the matrices where three different rows each appear once. There are $\\binom{18}{3} = 816$ such matrices.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of distinct matrices is $189 - 816/6 = 189 - 136 = 53$.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the matrices where two different rows appear three times each. There are $3 \\times \\binom{18}{2} = 486$ such matrices.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of distinct matrices is $53 - 486/6 = 53 - 81 = -28$.\n\nThis is not possible, so we must have made another mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work again.\n\nThe mistake is in the step where we calculated the number of matrices where two different rows each appear twice. We should have divided by $2! = 2$ for the matrices where two different rows each appear twice.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of matrices where two different rows each appear twice is $486/2 = 243$.\n\nSubtracting this from our previous total gives $432 - 243 = 189$.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the matrices where three different rows each appear once. There are $\\binom{18}{3} = 816$ such matrices.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of distinct matrices is $189 - 816/6 = 189 - 136 = 53$.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the matrices where two different rows appear three times each.

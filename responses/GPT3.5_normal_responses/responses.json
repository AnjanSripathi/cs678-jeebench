As the filament evaporates non-uniformly, the temperature distribution over the filament will not be uniform. The areas with less tungsten will heat up more quickly, leading to non-uniform temperature distribution.\n\n(B) The resistance over small sections of the filament decreases with time:\nThis statement is true. As the filament evaporates, the cross-sectional area of the filament decreases, leading to an increase in resistance. According to Ohm's Law (V = IR), if the voltage remains constant, an increase in resistance will result in a decrease in current. This decrease in current will lead to a decrease in the rate of evaporation in those sections, causing the resistance to decrease over time.\n\n(C) The filament emits more light at a higher band of frequencies before it breaks up:\nThis statement is false. As the filament heats up, it emits a continuous spectrum of black-body radiation. The distribution of emitted light is determined by the temperature of the filament, following Planck's law. The filament will emit light across a range of frequencies based on its temperature, and this distribution will not change significantly before it breaks up.\n\n(D) The filament consumes less electrical power towards the end of the life of the bulb:\nThis statement is false. As the filament evaporates and its resistance increases, the power consumed by the filament will increase according to P = VI. Since the voltage remains constant, the increase in resistance will lead to an increase in power consumption towards the end of the life of the bulb.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(B) The resistance over small sections of the filament decreases with time"

We can use the formula:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( E \\) is the energy of the photon,\n- \\( h \\) is the Planck's constant (\\( 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J s} \\)),\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light (\\( 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)),\n- \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength of the light.\n\nConverting the given wavelength from Angstroms to meters:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = 970 \\, \\text{A} = 970 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{m} = 9.7 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the formula to find the energy of the photon:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J s})(3.00 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s})}{9.7 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{m}} \\]\n\n\\[ E \\approx 2.04 \\times 10^{-18} \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert this energy from joules to electron volts (eV). We can use the conversion factor provided in the problem:\n\n\\[ 1 \\, \\text{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nConverting the energy:\n\n\\[ E \\approx \\frac{2.04 \\times 10^{-18} \\, \\text{J}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} \\approx 12.74 \\, \\text{eV} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the difference in energy between the ground state energy of the hydrogen atom and the energy of the absorbed photon:\n\n\\[ \\Delta E = 12.74 \\, \\text{eV} - (-13.6 \\, \\text{eV}) = 26.34 \\, \\text{eV} \\]\n\nThe energy difference corresponds to the energy of the emitted photon when the electron transitions back to a lower energy level. The energy of the emitted photon corresponds to the energy difference between two energy levels in the hydrogen atom.\n\nThe energy levels in a hydrogen atom are given by the formula:\n\n\\[ E_n = -\\frac{13.6 \\, \\text{eV}}{n^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the principal quantum number.\n\nWe need to find the possible values of \\( n \\) for which the energy difference is equal to 26.34 eV. We can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ -\\frac{13.6 \\, \\text{eV}}{n^2} - (-\\frac{13.6 \\, \\text{eV}}{(n+1)^2}) = 26.34 \\, \\text{eV} \\]\n\nSolving this equation will give us the possible values of \\( n \\) and hence the number of lines present in the emission spectrum.\n\nAfter solving the equation, we find that the possible values of \\( n \\) are 2 and 3. Therefore, there are 2 lines present in the emission spectrum.\n\nFinal Answer: 2"
